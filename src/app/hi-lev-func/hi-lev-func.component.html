    <p>Higher order functions can help you to step up your JavaScript game by making your code more declarative. That is, short, simple, and readable.

    A Higher Order Function is any function that returns a function when executed, takes a function as one or more of its arguments, or both. 
    If you have used any of the Array methods like map or filter, or passed a callback function to jQueryâ€™s $.get, you have already worked with Higher Order Functions.
    
    When you use Array.map, you provide a function as its only argument, which it applies to every element contained in the array.
    
    .map() is a high-order function. It allows a function to be passed as an argument.</p>
